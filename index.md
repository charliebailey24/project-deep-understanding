### Project Deep Understanding
A personal project to build an LLM from scratch.

#### Vision Statement

"What I cannot create, I do not understand." — Richard Feynman

My vision for this project is fairly simple—to build a large language model entirely from scratch. Starting with an empty GitHub repository, I plan to manually implement each part of a GPT-like LLM, with the aim of gaining a deep understanding of the fundamental principles that power modern generative AI. 

#### Motivation

My motivation for this project is driven by an intense fascination with, to my mind, potentially one of the most impactful technologies humanity has ever created. With hands-on experience building this technology I intend to gain the understanding and skills I need to contribute to this rapidly evolving field.

#### Specific and Measurable Goals

To aid in the completion of this project, I will be closely following the guidance laid out in Sebastian Raschka's book [Build a Large Language Model From Scratch](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Large-Language-Model-Scratch/dp/1633437167) (which I'll refer to as BaLLM from here on out). This book will serve as the milestone guide for this project which I will then supplement with addition resources like Andrej Karpthy's YouTube tutorial [Let's Build GPT](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=54-hUOEzilal2WMG). Here is a 12-week plan that closely follows the path laid out in BaLLM:

| Weeks | Goal |
|------|------|
| 1 | Setup environment and get familiar with PyTorch |
| 2 | Understand the architecture; read the "Attention is all you need" paper |
| 3 | Learn how to work with text data; tokenization, byte-pair encoding, etc |
| 4-5 | Code the attention mechanism |
| 6-8 | Implement the GPT architecture |
| 9 | Pretrain on unlabeled data |
| 10 | Fine-tune the model |
| 11-12 | Final polishing and buffer time for overruns |

This schedule is based on my initial skimming of the BaLLM chapters and initial estimates for how much time it would take to implement each chapter. The specific weekly work will likely change as I get into the build phase, but this general process plan should still hold throughout the project.

#### Risks to Project Completion

The biggest risk to this project completion is undoubtedly time management. I found that—given enough time—I can almost always solve technical obstacles. However, I also have other obligations and this project will not be the primary focus of my energy, so the risk is that it doesn't retain a high enough weight in my mental priority queue to get any meaningful work done.

#### Mitigation Strategy

I've implemented several strategies to mitigate the risk of not dedicating enough time to this project.

1. I've blocked off a 4-hour period on my calendar for every Thursday evening for the next 12 weeks.
2. I've setup a time tracking spreadsheet to explicitly track the time dedicated to this project. I'm striving to never leave a week without at least 4 hours of time dedicated to this project.
3. I've setup a project specific Trello board to help me keep track of all the tasks that need to be completed.

With these mitigation strategies in place, I feel confident that I can get this project completed on schedule.

#### Project Assessment

Similar to the vision, the assessment for this project is fairly simple—do I have a locally hosted, completely hand-built, GPT-like chatbot that I can query and generates coherent responses? If I can achieve that, I would consider this project a success.
