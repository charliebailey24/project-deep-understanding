# Project Updates

### Week 3:
#### What did you do last week?
I spent this past week doing a search for some additional resources and then put together the project proposal. I also setup a project Trello board with some initial tasks and built a simple time-tracking spreadsheet

#### What do you plan to do this week?
This week I plan to start implement on the timeline laid out in the proposal. I plan to:
* Read the BaLLM appendix on PyTorch
* Setup a suitable Docker Dev Container with all of the tools I'll need
* Get a "hello world" type program running in the new environment to make sure everything is working

#### Are there any impediments in your way?
I've found that environment setup can end up taking far longer than expected sometimes. I've only started using Docker in the past few months, so there may be some technical obstacles that I will have to overcome. PyTorch is a very well supported library though so I'm sure there will be ample documentation if I need to troubleshoot.

#### Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
This past week I basically saved all of my work—with the exception of some early week planning—for Thursday night. While it's nice to have a dedicated time block to work on this project, I think going forward I would like to break the work up a bit more throughout the week if at all possible.
